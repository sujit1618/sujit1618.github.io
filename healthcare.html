                    figure out what can be

                    on

                        <li>Client side teams often work in silos and very few people really understand how the overall
                            system works in large corporations.
                        </li>
                        <li>People are hesitant at first to start prototyping but can have a lot of fun and enjoy the
                            process if given the right push.
                        </li>
                        <li>The design thinking vagueness is difficult for most non designers to accept, but striving to
                            build trust throughout the workshop is very rewarding at the end.
                        </li>
                        <li>Innovation is most commonly associated with technology, and leveraging research to help
                            people understand other people's lives and empathize with users is a great way to break this
                            pattern.
