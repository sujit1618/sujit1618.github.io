                    Most of my teammates were expert engineers, and did
                    not have prior experience with the design process. We needed a way of working which was as effective
                    as the double diamond, while being comfortable for engineers or people with a more solution oriented
                    mindset to follow the first time round.

                    The process we came up with <i> (over multiple iterations, of course!) </i> extended the linear
                    solution driven method with
                    design research, and a bit of speculation about upcoming problems in the larger system of things.

                        packages were delivered at our respective residences and countries, and looked up current

                <p>After talking with other participants and discussing amongst ourselves, drones came up to be the most
                    popular word on everyone’s mind. The roadblocks which we found drones suffer from are battery
                    problems, that powerful batteries are heavier and need more power to lift, which limits the distance
                    to which drones can travel.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How might we reduce the distance that drones have to travel in order to reach their
                        destination?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    What if drones could hop on and off public transit vehicles?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The solution was compatible with two future states- cities banning private cars from city centers
                    and wanting to increase public transit usage, and with the fact that drones provided flexible
                    deliveries.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Did that solve the problem?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Not really, it raised more questions than it answered.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Will governments allow drones in urban areas in the near future?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    This system was problematic since it was unlikely that the FAA will permit companies to deliver
                    packages via drones in the near future due to citizens' concerns regarding privacy and security.
                    Moreover, failure rates of common drone parts like bearings make it dangerous for drones with
                    packages to fly over populated areas.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How might we provide the same flexibility and convenience which drones would have provided
                        without using drones?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Replacing drones with people, and creating a gig economy based service for package deliveries was
                    the identified as the next best step.
                    <br><br>
                    This new system could also potentially help build communities,
                    especially during holidays and festivals, when an exponential increase in online orders could pave
                    the way for people to meet their neighbors and wish them good health.

                    <br><br>
                    Security in the gig economy package delivery service would be complicated, with mandatory background
                    checks and other measures to ensure safety of everyone involved. Additionally, trains and buses
                    would need to stand still at stops for a lot longer, which would be a disservice to passengers.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How might we reduce the time required for loading and unloading packages?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    We realized that taking transfers between multiple modes of transportation out of the equation, and
                    only leveraging city wide bus networks was the perfect solution. This concept was prototyped through
                    a stop-motion animation and wireframes of the user facing app.
