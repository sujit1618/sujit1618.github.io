                            More than 375,000 babies are born preterm every year in the United States, of which 5250
                            babies pass away due to causes related to premature births or low birth weight.

                            low income groups. Our client, a health insurance company, was planning a pilot in this
                            space to reduce preterm deliveries among vulnerable populations, & had asked us to conduct a
                            research study to gauge the effectiveness of the proposed intervention.

                        According to March of Dimes, a non-profit organization that works to improve the lives
                        of mothers
                        and babies, premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and its complications
                        are the #1
                        cause of death of babies in the United States. Babies who survive premature birth often
                        have
                        long-term health problems, including cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, chronic

                        The CDC found in a 2018 study that nearly 1 in 10 babies is born prematurely in the US,
                        and that
                        racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates remain. For example, in 2018, the
                        rate of
                        preterm birth among African-American women (14%) was about 50 percent higher than the
                        rate of
                        preterm birth among white women (9%).

                    I worked with the rest of the team to plan the research, prototyped multiple ways to conduct remote

                    required to comply with, and would instead prefer to take this opportunity to tell you about how we
                    conducted remote studies with the participants in West Virginia and Texas. They are particularly
                    interesting because we experimented with various tools which are readily available on the internet
                    and the research participants' phones in order to conduct research, by creating a combination of card sorts and diary
                    studies which participants could answer as per their own schedules and free time.
                    <br><br>
                    After secondary research and interviews with subject matter experts and client-side stakeholders, we
                    reached out to a recruiting agency to search for research participants- women from a range of
                    socio-economic backgrounds who were either predisposed towards pre-term labour, or had given birth
                    before week 37 of pregnancy.
                    <br><br>
                    Our research was spread across three different states in the United States- Illinois, Texas, and
                    Virginia, to accommodate states with historically higher rates of pre-term labour and related
                    complications.

                    The goal of the research was to understand the daily lives of the participants- their schedules,
                    habits, family life, medical history, healthcare related experiences, things which made them feel
                    empowered, barriers and challenges towards taking care of themselves. To understand the frequency of
                    their habits and actions, we decided to use card sorting with illustrations of these activities as
                    conversation starters, to accompany a semi-structured interview.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to travel constraints at the time of the study, we decided to split our research into
                    two modes.

                    based on daily prompts.
