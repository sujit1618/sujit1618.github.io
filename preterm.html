                        and babies, premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and its complications
                        are the #1

                        preterm birth among African-American women (14%) was about 50 percent higher than the

                    After secondary research and interviews with subject matter experts and client-side stakeholders, we
                    reached out to a recruiting agency to search for research participants- women from a range of
                    socio-economic backgrounds who were either predisposed towards pre-term labour, or had given birth
                    before week 37 of pregnancy. Our research participant sample set was spread across three different
                    states in the United States-
                    Illinois, Texas, and Virginia to accommodate states with historically higher rates of pre-term
                    labour and related
                    complications.

                    The goal of the research was to understand the daily lives of the participants- their schedules,
                    habits, family life, medical history, healthcare related experiences, things which made them feel
                    empowered, and barriers or challenges towards taking care of themselves. To understand the frequency
                    of
                    their habits and actions, we decided to use an activity based card sort to accompany a
                    semi-structured in-person interview for the research participants in Illinois.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn't possible for us to travel to the participants' locations in Texas and Virginia due to
                    budget and timeline constraints, but we still needed a comprehensive understanding of their health
                    actions, habits and lives.
                    <br><br>
                    The question in front of us was- how do we get <b>in-depth, high quality information from
                        people we couldn't meet?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to try <b>remote interviews </b>with an <b>online whiteboard based card sort, </b>with a
                    <b>digital diary study,</b> and a <b>form based survey </b>to cover any more questions we may have
                    towards the end of the study.

                <p>The first thing we tried was using online whiteboards like Miro and Mural for the card sort. Here's
                    an example we built on Miro (left) and tested out on the android app (right).

                    What we realised was that using the mobile app for this exercise was vexing due to the small screen size
                    of mobile phones. Additionally, most participants did not have laptops or personal computers, and
                    would have needed to install the respective whiteboard app on their phones to participate in the study-
                    something our recruiter told us the participants were not comfortable doing. We also tried to
                    conduct the phone interviews amongst ourselves while parallely using the whiteboard app, and observed
                    technical glitches like dropped calls and frozen screens especially on budget devices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The next option was to explore different form builders and convert the card sort activity into a drop down based question. This would be the simplest way to implement the card sort, and we decided to ask participants questions about the card sort in a phone call towards the end of the research.
                    <br><br>
                    For this exercise, we explored Google Forms, Typeform, and Zoho Forms.
