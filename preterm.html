                        of mothers
                        and babies, premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and its complications
                        are the #1
                        cause of death of babies in the United States. Babies who survive premature birth often
                        have
                        long-term health problems, including cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, chronic

                        The CDC found in a 2018 study that nearly 1 in 10 babies is born prematurely in the US,
                        and that
                        racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates remain. For example, in 2018, the
                        rate of
                        preterm birth among African-American women (14%) was about 50 percent higher than the
                        rate of

                    <br><br>
                    My core responsibilities were to <b>design the remote research experience, implement it, support the

                    After conducting secondary research and interviewing subject matter experts and client-side
                    stakeholders, we
                    contracted a recruiting agency to search for research participants- women from a range of
                    socio-economic backgrounds who were either <b>predisposed towards pre-term labour,</b> or had
                    <b>medical history of a premature delivery.</b>
                    Our research participant sample set was spread across three different
                    states in the United States-
                    Illinois, Texas, and Virginia, to <b>accommodate states with historically higher rates</b> of
                    pre-term
                    labour and related
                    complications.

                    Our goal was to understand the daily lives of the participants- their schedules,
                    habits, family life, medical history, healthcare related experiences, things which made them feel
                    empowered, and barriers or challenges towards taking care of themselves. To understand the frequency
                    of their habits and actions, we decided to use an <b>activity based card sort to accompany a
                        semi-structured in-person interview</b> for the research participants in Illinois.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn't possible for us to travel to the participants' locations in Texas and Virginia due to
                    budget and timeline constraints, but we still needed a comprehensive understanding of their health
                    actions, habits and lives.
                    <br><br>
                    The question in front of us was- how do we get <b>in-depth, high quality information from
                        people we couldn't meet?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to try <b>remote interviews </b>with an <b>online whiteboard based card sort, </b>with a
                    <b>digital diary study,</b> and a <b>form based survey </b>to cover any more questions we may have
                    towards the end of the study.

                    of mobile phones. Additionally, <b>most participants did not have laptops or personal computers,</b>
                    and
                    would have needed to install the respective whiteboard app on their phones to participate in the
                    study-
                    something our recruiter told us the <b>participants were not comfortable doing.</b> We also tried to
                    conduct the phone interviews amongst ourselves while parallely using the whiteboard app, and
                    observed
                    technical glitches like dropped calls and frozen screens especially on budget devices.

                    <br>
                    The next option was to explore different form builders and convert the card sort activity into a
                    drop-down based question. This would be the simplest way to implement the card sort, and we would
                    ask them about their form responses in an interview towards the end of the study.
                    <br><br>
                    For this exercise, we explored Google Forms, Typeform, and Zoho Forms.

                </div>
                <p>After testing different types of questions and comparing the user interface of the forms
                    on mobile devices, we found that Typeform suited our needs and provided a seamless experience for
                    the research participants.
                    Here's an example of the card sort that we created for the final exercise.

                <div class="caps-heading">Designing the diary study</div>
                <p>For creating the diary study, we took a look at note-taking tools like Notes, Evernote, and Google
                    Keep, of which we found Evernote's templates to be most suited to our needs. Some of our
                    participants were
                    also already using the Evernote app for their personal use, which we saw as a positive.
                </p>

                <div class="image-section">
                    <div class="image-container-full">

                </div>

                <p>
                    However, Evernote did not allow us to share notebooks with other users. Also since we learnt from
                    the recruiter that some participants were not comfortable installing new apps on their devices,
                    we started exploring alternatives that were already available on our participants' devices, like
                    texting.
                    <br><br>
                    The research app Indeemo was also seen as an option when we were testing Evernote, but since it too
                    required that users install a new app, we did not explore it further.
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to create a <b>diary experience using text messaging,</b> where we gave the research
                    participants daily prompts, and asked them to respond with photos and descriptions. On the research
                    team's side, we masked my phone number using a Google Voice number, and received the
                    participants' text messages and images directly on our computers. This <b>streamlined the process of
                        downloading the images and organizing the responses</b>. It also made it much faster to
                    share the responses with the rest of the research team.

                    The remote research study was planned for a total of 3 days, during which we asked them to

                <ul class="body-ul">
                    <li>Participate in an initial interview over phone</li>

                    <br>
                    The questions were updated daily on a Google Sites webpage that we used as a <b>bulletin board for
                        participants</b> to come to every day and get
                    links and prompts for the day's exercises and survey.

                    The research exercise was a success, and we received a lot of high quality data from both online and
                    offline parts of the study. Our clients <b>appreciated the amount of effort and attention to
                        detail</b> we
                    had put in, especially for the online remote studies.

                    We presented <b>insights from the study and opportunity areas</b> for future interventions in this space
                     to prevent pre-term deliveries, and handed
                    over the project data to the client.
