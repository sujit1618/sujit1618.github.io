                    According to March of Dimes, a non-profit organization that works to improve the lives of mothers
                    and babies, premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and its complications are the #1
                    cause of death of babies in the United States. Babies who survive premature birth often have
                    long-term health problems, including cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, chronic lung
                    disease, blindness and hearing loss.
                    <br><br>
                    The CDC found in a 2018 study that nearly 1 in 10 babies is born prematurely in the US, and that
                    racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth rates remain. For example, in 2018, the rate of
                    preterm birth among African-American women (14%) was about 50 percent higher than the rate of
                    preterm birth among white women (9%).

                <p>Our client, a leading health insurance carrier, decided to tackle this problem to see what can be
                    done. Our team at Panorama Innovation worked hand in hand with our client’s research teams and
                    conducted qualitative research remotely and in-person across three states.
                    <br><br>
                    I worked with the rest of the team to plan the research, prototype multiple ways to conduct remote
                    research, conduct secondary research, and recruit research participants from non-profit
                    organizations and other stakeholders, interview participants, analyze the information that we
                    collected, and present our findings to our clients.

                    <b>My core responsibilities were to design the remote research experience, implement it, support the
                        participants during the actual research phase, and provide our team with the data received
                        during it.‍

                <p>Our research took us through lots of interviews with professionals in the healthcare industry, as
                    well as with causes and organizations which are working hard to prevent preterm labor and support
                    newborns to lead healthy lives. Most importantly, we reached out to women who either were pregnant
                    during the time of this study, had a history of preterm delivery, or were predisposed to preterm
                    labor as per their medical background. We also took care to ensure that we were speaking to women
                    from a diverse range of socio-economic status, ethnicities, and had different pre-existing medical
                    conditions which could potentially affect the pregnancy.

                    I am unable to share this study and it’s findings in detail due to non-disclosure agreements I am
                    required to comply with, and would instead prefer to take this opportunity to tell you about how we
                    conducted remote studies with the participants in West Virginia and Texas. They are particularly
                    interesting because we experimented with various tools which are readily available on the internet
                    and people’s phones in order to conduct research, by creating a combination of card sorts and diary
                    studies which participants could answer as per their own schedules and free time.
